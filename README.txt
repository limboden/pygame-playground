With this branch, we have a little 2D dodging simulator that gets 
more difficult as you pass levels



Problems:
currently, when you lose a level, the game over screen has a next level 
button, and it actually takes you to the next level, even though you lost
the level. not good. There should be 2 buttons, one that says restart level, and one that says, level 1 or something.
